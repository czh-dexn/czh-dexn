<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="18px" height="18px"> **Welcome to my GitHub!** I'm Deon, a developer passionate about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I'm dedicated to self-directed learning and hands-on projects to build a deep understanding of these cutting-edge technologies.

Iâ€™m particularly interested in how AI can enhance game development, aiming to create immersive experiences where NPCs have dynamic personalities and storylines adapt naturally. While generative AI and game design are key focuses, I'm always exploring new areas and eager to learn and create diverse projects.

Outside of coding, youâ€™ll find me chasing the adrenaline of speed â€” whether on virtual racetracks or coupled watching F1. For me, itâ€™s not just about specsâ€”itâ€™s about the feel of raw performance. This passion fuels my drive to build tools that push boundaries both in technology and beyond.

Let's connect and collaborate on projects that blend creativity with advanced tech, whether it's through innovative software or high-octane engineering!

## ðŸŒŸ About Me 

Currently diving into ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000?style=flat-square&logo=rust&logoColor=white) and  ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-000000?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=white) to develop skills applicable to AI/ML workflows and low-level systems programming. My goal is to build a strong foundation in machine learning algorithms, model building, and AI systems while mastering low-level languages to enhance my versatility as a developer.

 I'm always looking to connect with individuals from around the world who share a passion for AI/ML and believe in learning through doing. I value building and experimenting, focusing on mastering the fundamentals before diving into larger contributions.

I believe in learning by building and experimenting, and Iâ€™m not rushing into contributions but instead focusing on mastering the fundamentals.
